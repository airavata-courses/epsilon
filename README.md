## About

"Reflectivity" is the amount of transmitted power returned to the radar receiver after hitting precipitation, compared to a reference power density at a distance of 1 meter from the radar antenna. <br/>
Epsilon will help you visualise the Reflectivity at various locations in the US for any given date and time.
